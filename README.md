MarkView! | Markdown Previewer

This repository contains a simple web-based Markdown previewer that allows you to write and preview Markdown code in real-time. The previewer is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses the marked.js library for Markdown parsing.
Usage

To use the Markdown previewer, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The previewer interface is divided into two panes: the editor pane and the preview pane.

In the editor pane, you can enter your Markdown code. As you type, the preview pane will update in real-time to show you how your Markdown will be rendered.
Customization

The Markdown previewer is designed to be easy to customize and extend. You can customize the appearance of the previewer by modifying the CSS styles in the styles.css file.

You can also extend the functionality of the previewer by adding additional libraries or plugins. For example, you could add support for additional Markdown syntax by including a different Markdown parser library.
